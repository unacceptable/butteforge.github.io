- `favicon.ico` - Site favicon
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build (Jekyll + nginx) for local preview
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose config to run the site locally on port 8080
- `Gemfile` - Ruby dependencies for Jekyll / GitHub Pages
- `README.md` - Human-readable project documentation
- `AGENTS.md` - This file (instructions for AI agents; excluded from site build)

## Content Rules

- All site content is written in Markdown, rendered by Jekyll with kramdown.
- Do not use emoji characters in any file.
- Do not use em-dashes (U+2014).
- Do not use en-dashes (U+2013).
- Do not use double hyphens (`--`) as separators; use a single hyphen instead.
- Keep line lengths reasonable (under 120 characters where practical).
- Do not duplicate the header or footer in page content; they are rendered
  automatically by the shared layout.

## Jekyll and Build

- The site uses the `minima` theme. Do not change the theme without explicit approval.
- The `_config.yml` file controls site metadata, theme, and build exclusions.
- Files listed under `exclude` in `_config.yml` are not published to the site. Keep `AGENTS.md`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Gemfile`, and `Gemfile.lock` excluded.
- To test locally, run `docker compose up --build -d` and visit `http://localhost:8080`.
- To stop the local preview, run `docker compose down`.
- **After any change to a Markdown (`.md`) page or `_config.yml`, rebuild the
  container** with `docker compose up --build -d` so the change can be
  verified locally.

## Layouts and Includes (DRY)

- `_layouts/default.html` is the base layout. It includes the shared header
  and footer automatically. All pages should use `layout: default` in their
  front matter.
- `_includes/header.html` renders the logo, site title, and navigation links.
  Navigation is driven by the `nav` list in `_config.yml`, which defines
  dropdown groups and their child pages.
- `_includes/footer.html` renders the copyright and site description.
  Footer navigation mirrors the `nav` structure from `_config.yml`.
- To change the header or footer site-wide, edit the corresponding file in
  `_includes/`. Do not duplicate header/footer content in individual pages.

## Adding New Pages

1. Create a new `.md` file inside the appropriate `pages/` subdirectory
   (e.g., `pages/about/`, `pages/departments/`, `pages/activity/`).
2. Add front matter at the top with `layout: default`, a `title`, and a
   `permalink` matching the subdirectory structure:
   ```
   ---
   layout: default
   title: Page Title
   permalink: /section/page-title.html
   ---
   ```
3. Add the page path to the appropriate group under the `nav` list in
   `_config.yml` so it appears in the dropdown navigation.
4. Do not place site pages in the repository root. Only infrastructure files
   (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, etc.) belong in the root.
5. Do not add `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, or other infrastructure files to
   `nav`.

## Blog Posts

- Blog posts live in `_posts/`. This is a special Jekyll directory; do not
  rename or move it.
- Each filename must follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Posts use `layout: post` and must include `title`, `date`, and a nested
  `author` with `name` and `email` in the front matter.
- The permalink pattern in `_config.yml` (`/blog/:slug.html`) maps posts
  to `/blog/` URLs automatically.
- The blog listing page (`pages/blog.md`) loops over `site.posts` and
  renders each post as a card.

## CSS Guidelines

- All custom styles live in `assets/css/style.scss`.
- Keep CSS DRY by using CSS custom properties (variables) defined in the
  `:root` block at the top of the stylesheet.
- Never hardcode colors, font stacks, border-radii, or transition values
  inline in rules. Use the existing `--color-*`, `--font-*`, `--radius-*`,
  `--transition*`, `--shadow-*`, and `--hl-*` variables instead.
- When a new value is needed in more than one rule, add a variable to
  `:root` first and reference it everywhere.
- Do not duplicate selectors. If two selectors share the same declarations,
  combine them into a single comma-separated selector.

## SVG Icons

- Never inline SVG markup directly in HTML templates. Always break SVGs out
  into separate files.
- Standalone SVG source files go in `assets/icons/` (e.g.,
  `assets/icons/icon-email.svg`).
- For SVGs that need to be rendered inline in layouts or includes, create a
  corresponding partial in `_includes/icons/` (e.g.,
  `_includes/icons/email.html`) and use `{% include icons/email.html %}`.
- The `_includes/icons/` partials may include presentation attributes like
  `class`, `width`, and `height` so they render correctly in context.
- Do not embed raw `<svg>` tags in `_includes/header.html`,
  `_includes/footer.html`, or any layout file.
